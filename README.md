# AP Bill OCR Worker (Cloud Run)

This service moves the heavy AP bill OCR flow out of Google Apps Script to avoid Apps Script quotas.

## What this implements

- Cloud Run worker with `GET/POST /run` HTTP endpoint.
- Routing read from Google Sheets (`ProjectRouting`) via Sheets API.
- Odoo XML-RPC execution (`authenticate`, `execute_kw`, `search_read`, `create`, `write`).
- OCR path:
  - image files -> Vision `images:annotate`
  - PDF files -> Vision async OCR through GCS staging
- Gemini structured extraction for invoice fields.
- Vendor lookup, duplicate check, bill create, and processed markers.
- Optional cursor state storage in GCS per target key.
- Thin Apps Script trigger option (`apps_script_thin_trigger.gs`) for hybrid mode.

## Folder layout

- `src/server.js` - HTTP server and run lock.
- `src/worker.js` - orchestration and business flow.
- `src/odoo.js` - XML-RPC client wrapper for Odoo.
- `src/vision.js` - Vision OCR helpers.
- `src/gemini.js` - Gemini structured extraction call.
- `src/sheets.js` - routing loader from Google Sheets.
- `src/state.js` - state load/save from GCS object.
- `apps_script_thin_trigger.gs` - optional minimal Apps Script trigger.
- `deploy_cloud_run.ps1` - build and deploy helper.
- `cloudbuild.yaml` - Cloud Build config for CI (build + deploy to Cloud Run).
- `create_scheduler_job.ps1` - Cloud Scheduler helper.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.

Required:

- `SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `GCS_BUCKET`

Strongly recommended:

- `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET` (required if endpoint is exposed)
- `STATE_BUCKET` (for cross-run cursor state)
- `DEFAULT_EXPENSE_ACCOUNT_ID` (fallback account for invoice line)

## Security

**Never commit real credentials.** Use `.env` for local secrets (gitignored). `.env.example` contains placeholders only.

**If an API key was exposed** (e.g. in a public repo):

1. **Regenerate the Gemini API key** in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) or [GCP Console → APIs & Services → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. In Credentials, find the key → Edit → **Regenerate key**.
3. Update your local `.env`, Cloud Run secrets, and any deployment scripts with the new key.
4. Restrict the new key: Edit → Application restrictions (e.g. IP, referrer) and API restrictions (limit to Gemini/Vision APIs you use).

## Local run

1. Install Node.js 20+.
2. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
3. Start:
   - `npm start`
4. Health check:
   - `GET http://localhost:8080/healthz`
5. Trigger run:
   - `POST http://localhost:8080/run` with header `x-worker-secret`.

## Deploy to Cloud Run

Use `deploy_cloud_run.ps1`:

```powershell
.\deploy_cloud_run.ps1 -ProjectId "<project-id>" -Region "<region>" -ServiceName "ap-bill-ocr-worker" -ServiceAccount "<sa>@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

Then create scheduler:

```powershell
.\create_scheduler_job.ps1 -ProjectId "<project-id>" -Region "<region>" -WorkerUrl "https://<service-url>" -WorkerSecret "<secret>"
```

## Redeploy on git push (GitHub + Cloud Build)

1. **Connect GitHub**
   - Open [Cloud Build → Repositories](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/repositories) (project `odoo-ocr-487104`).
   - Select the **1st gen** tab → **Connect repository**.
   - Source: **GitHub (Cloud Build GitHub App)** → Continue.
   - Sign in to GitHub if needed; install **Google Cloud Build** on your account/org and choose **Only select repositories** → pick this repo → Install.
   - Back in GCP: choose the repo, accept the disclaimer → **Connect**.

2. **Create trigger**
   - Go to [Cloud Build → Triggers](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers).
   - **Create trigger**.
   - Name: e.g. `ap-bill-ocr-worker-deploy`.
   - Event: **Push to a branch**; pick the repo you connected; branch `^master$` (or your main branch).
   - Configuration: **Cloud Build configuration file**; path `cloudbuild.yaml` (leave default).
   - (Optional) Substitution variables: `_REGION` = `asia-southeast1`, `_SERVICE_NAME` = `ap-bill-ocr-worker` (defaults are already in `cloudbuild.yaml`).
   - **Create**.

3. **IAM**
   - Cloud Build’s service account needs to deploy to Cloud Run and push to Artifact Registry. In project **IAM**, find `PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com` and ensure it has **Cloud Run Admin** and **Artifact Registry Writer** (or **Storage Admin** if using GCR). If you used the same project and ran `gcloud builds submit` before, this is usually already set.

After this, every push to the selected branch will build the image and redeploy `ap-bill-ocr-worker` to Cloud Run in `asia-southeast1`.

## IAM and API requirements

Enable APIs:

- Cloud Run
- Cloud Build
- Cloud Scheduler
- Vision API
- Cloud Storage
- Sheets API

Service account permissions:

- `roles/run.invoker` (if secured invocation is used)
- `roles/storage.objectAdmin` (for OCR staging and state objects)
- `roles/visionai.editor` or equivalent Vision usage role
- Sheets read access to your routing spreadsheet (share the sheet with SA email)

## Cutover strategy

1. Deploy worker and run it manually on a test routing row.
2. Verify created Odoo bills match expected values.
3. Enable Cloud Scheduler or import `apps_script_thin_trigger.gs`.
4. Disable the heavy trigger in your old Apps Script.
5. Keep old script for fallback until new pipeline is stable.

## Notes on parity

This implementation ports the core behavior from your Apps Script:

- per-target polling
- OCR and extraction
- idempotency marker write-back to `ir.attachment.description`

If you need strict one-to-one parity with every helper from the original script (for example vendor rules, deep tax heuristics, and exact account scoring), extend `src/worker.js` with those functions and keep the same naming to simplify verification.
